# Deepak-Abhinav-Portfolio
Hey this is a simple portfolio I have created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the use of DOM events etc. You are free to change this however you prefer and do whatever with it, the code used is relatively simple and I have particularly avoided making some parts of the code efficient, just so that it is easy to understand for beginners.
Have a fun time exploring HTML, CSS, and JS whilst learning stuff about me!
